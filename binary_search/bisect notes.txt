Bisect left and bisect right work as follows:

1. If element is present in the array:
    1.1 Bisect left gives the index of the element (ie index)
    1.2 Bisect right gives the index of the element that is one greater (ie index + 1)

2. If element in not present in the array:
    2.1 Bisect left gives the index of the next greater element
    2.2 Bisect right gives the index of the next greater element
